# VSS Catalog

The source for the COVESA VSS Catalog can be found in `*.vspec` files in the [COVESA VSS Repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
Released versions of the catalog in various formats can be found at [release artifacts](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/releases).

Each signal in the VSS catalog has a `description` field and they may have a `comment` field. In some cases that is not sufficient to explain the rationale for the signal and how it is intended to be used. This section of the VSS documentation gives additional information on selected signal.

## VSS Catalog Concepts
